# Visualization Project

The content of the webpage is developed as a student project for the course "Visualisation". 
The goal is to get quick insights about the content of the election programs of the parties 
for the 2021 german federal election.

A Wordcloud, a Bar Chart and a Table are used for visualization. 

In the Wordcloud two parties can be selected from a dropdown menu. The parties can be distinguished
by their color.

The Bar chart can be used to freely search for words and compare those words across all parties.

The table is not interactive but shows the three most important words of each party.
